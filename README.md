## About
Begin grasping coding fundamentals by creating a simple console chat bot from scratch. This bot will be able to engage 
in basic conversation with you and perform simple arithmetic. During this journey, you will play some word and number 
games that you are going to implement on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road!

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

* Stage 1/5: Meet your chat bot
  * Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Introduction to Java
    * Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
    * Writing first program
    * Printing data
* Stage 2/5: Introduce yourself
  * Introduce yourself to the bot.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Types and variables
    * Comments
    * Reading user's input with Scanner
    * Coding style conventions
    * Naming variables
* Stage 3/5: Let the chat bot guess your age
  * Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Arithmetic operations
    * Integer types and operations
    * Increment and decrement
    * Characters
    * String
* Stage 4/5: Teach your bot to count
  * Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!
  * Stage Topics:
    * Floating-point types
    * Boolean type and operations. True and false
    * Comparing values. Relational operators
    * Conditional statement
    * One-line condition with ternary operator
    * For loop
* Stage 5/5: Play a simple quiz together
  * At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some 
    functions to your code and make the stage even better.
